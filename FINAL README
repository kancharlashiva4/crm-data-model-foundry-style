# CRM Data Model (Foundry-Style Project)

This project demonstrates how I designed a CRM-style data model inspired by my work in Palantir Foundry.

The goal was to transform messy raw datasets into a clean, explorable business model.

## 🧱 Core Entities

The system models three main objects:

- PERSON – individuals working at companies  
- COMPANY – organizations employing people  
- EMPLOYMENT – relationship object linking people to companies  

This reflects a real-world many-to-many structure.

## 🔄 Data Pipeline Flow

1. Raw datasets uploaded (People + Companies)
2. Cleaning pipelines remove duplicates, standardize fields, and generate keys
3. Cleaned datasets power ontology objects
4. Employment object links PERSON and COMPANY
5. Dashboard visualizes CRM relationships

## 📌 Why This Project Matters

This project shows how I approach real-world data problems:

- Understanding raw data structure
- Designing meaningful business objects
- Connecting pipelines to ontology
- Making data explorable for users

This mirrors how production data platforms are built in enterprise environments.
